These are some scripts that I made so that I can update certain statistics in my stream without having to go through the trouble of manually updating a text file every time something needs to be changed. Now you can just click a specific button (that can be changed to your preference) to add values to that statistic.

Possibly more types of scripts to come, but for now they will just be little projects that I can implement into my hobbies.
